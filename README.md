# LIFE 24 
Daily Activity Tracker. 
It can track your daily activity and your weight.

# Motivation
This project will hopefully ALWAYS be FREE but we are very glad for sponsors.  
I have been a big fan using ENDOMONDO but it has come to an end 2020-12-31. This will be a BETTER replacement and also making things 
FREE.  

# Build status
We are still in an early-stage of development. 

# Folders
Root - here are the index.html and manifest files for the Progressive Web apps feature
